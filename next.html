                <p><b>29th July 2019:</b>
                    So,I chatted with A new Person today. Her Name is Sneha.
                    She was A Bengali and here I was talking to her in Hindi at start XD.
                    Really felt like I talked to someone freely after so much time..
                    Actually, I am quite eager to meet her tommorow...She seems like a really nice person..
                </p>
                <p><b>30th July 2019:</b>
                    Now guess what happened? She texted-"Suddenly shamne?"...Well shamne boshe o I was trying to see
                    her, and i think we saw each other once...
                    We returned from the induction programme and continued to chat with each other...I dont know why..
                    On returning, as we talked in the evening I was so eager to talk to her again..and got a feeling as
                    if I knew
                    her so much..
                    there was a strange sense of comfort..talking with nobody ever made me feel this.
                    Why cant I wait for tommorow to meet her?
                    BTW She is damn beautiful.
                </p>
                <p><b>Subsequently</b>
                    Emm..something is happening to me.The most exciting part about induction programme had become,
                    talking to her in evening after
                    returning from
                    SAC and being able to see her..sit beside her.
                    <br>
                    Now the most exciting part of class schedule is becoming being able to see her.
                    I think I am falling in love with her the more I know her and talk with her..
                    The sense of comfort, the feeling of knowing her and at the same time wanting to know her more and
                    more..its unreal
                </p>
                <p><b>13th August 2019:</b>
                    How nervous I was, only I know. The rain was playing spoil-sport for a long time, but it finally
                    stopped.We started walking
                    towards the residential area..and finally gathering courage..I stopped us and proposed to Her. God
                    knows how nervous I was. I guess it is natural since here I was
                    proposing to the girl who had my heart with her.
                    And when She said "Same Here"..I cant express all the feelings in words.
                    We held hands for the first time, and walked these roads so many times, we lost count.
                </p>

                    Aishik has become Visy now. And he loves it. <br>
                    Never thought could love someone so much. Never thought one my day will begin with the thought of
                    her, the thought of meeting her. The thought of talking with her. Being with her. And the night
                    fades away with the
                    thought of her...You are the best person Sneha.
